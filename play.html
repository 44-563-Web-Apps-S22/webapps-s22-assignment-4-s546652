        <h3>SCENE 1</h3>
        <h3>Orgon, Mariane</h3>
        <h3>Orgon.  Mariane.</h3>
<pre>
<b>Mariane.</b> Yes.
<b>Orgon.</b>   Come here.  We need to speak Privately.
<b>Mariane.</b>        Father, what is it you seek?
<b>Orgon</b><b> [looking in the closet].</b> I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.
        This is a perfect place for such a purpose.
        There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
        You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind
        And you have always been most dear to me.
<b>Mariane.</b>  A father's love brings true felicity.
<b>Orgon.</b>  Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully
        You should devote yourself to contenting me.
<b>Mariane.</b>  That's how my devotion is put to the proof.
<b>Orgon.</b>  Good.  Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?
<b>Mariane.</b>  Who me?
<b>Orgon. </b>  You.  Think well before you reply.
<b>Mariane. </b>Oh my!  Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.

<b><i>[Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.]</i></b>

<b>Orgon.</b>  That's sensibly spoken.  Now tell me, girl,
        That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
        That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
        To have him be your husband by my choice.
        Eh?

[Mariane recoils in dismay.]

<b>Mariane.</b>   Eh?
<b>Orgon.  </b>   What's that?
<b>Mariane.</b>   Please?
<b>Orgon.  </b>   What?
<b>Mariane. </b>  Am I in error?
<b>Orgon. </b> Why?
<b>Mariane.</b> Whom do you wish that I should now swear
        Touches my heart--and who would rejoice me
        If we joined, by your choice, in matrimony?
<b>Orgon.</b>5Tartuffe.
<b>Mariane.</b> Out of the question, father, I assure
        You!  Why urge on me such an imposture?
<b>Orgon.</b>  But, my dear, I wish it to be true,
        And it should be enough that I've chosen for you.
<b>Mariane.</b>  What?  Father, would you . . .?
<b>Orgon. </b>  Yes, I intend, you see
        To unite in marriage Tartuffe and my family.
        He will be your husband.  I do declare it!
        Since you have promised . . .

<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<h3>Dorine, Orgon, Mariane</h3>

<b>Orgon [perceiving Dorine].</b>  What do you stare at?
        You must be eaten up with curiosity
        To eavesdrop on my daughter and me.
<b>Dorine.</b>  I don't know whether the rumor I hear
        Is sly conjecture or a wicked smear;
        But I've just heard word of this marriage,
        And I trust it is only verbiage.
<b>Orgon.</b>  Why?  Is the idea itself so very absurd?
<b>Dorine.</b>  I wouldn't believe it, sir, if you gave your word!
<b>Orgon. </b> I will make you believe it by-and-by.
<b>Dorine.</b>  Yes. You're going to tell us a bald-faced lie.
<b>Orgon.</b>  I am only saying what you will soon see.
<b>Dorine.</b> Nonsense!
<b>Orgon.</b> What I say, dear girl, will soon be.
<b>Dorine. </b> Go on.  Don't believe him!  It's too bizarre!
        He's joking.
<b>Orgon. </b>  I say . . .
<b>Dorine. </b> No, you've gone too far,
        And no one believes you.
<b>Orgon. </b>  Damn you, you shrew . . .
<b>Dorine. </b> Well, I believe you then; the worse for you.
        What?  Monsieur, can you pose as one who's sage,
        Gravely stroking your bearded visage?
        And still be fool enough to wish . . .
<b>Orgon.</b> Hear me!
        I have given you too much liberty,
        And it no longer gives me any pleasure.
<b>Dorine. </b> Monsieur, please.  Keep your anger within measure.
        Are you mocking us with your silly plot?
        Your daughter is no match for a bigot;
        He has other schemes to worry about.
        And what would you gain if she wed this lout?
        With your wealth, what benefit would it bring
        To pick a bum . . .
<b>Orgon.</b> Ssh!  Say he has nothing;
        For that reason, you should revere him the more.
        He is a holy man and nobly poor.
        It raises him up to greater grandeur
        That he has renounced all wealth by his pure
        Detachment from the merely temporal
        And his powerful love for the Eternal.
        But my assistance may give him the means
        To restore his lands and remove his liens.
        He is a man of repute in the land of his birth,
        And, even as he is, he's a man of worth.
<b>Dorine.</b>  Yes, so he tells us, but his vanity
        Does not sit so well with true piety.
        A man pleased with a simple sanctity
        Needn't vaunt his name and his dignity,
        And the humility born of devotion
        Suffers beneath such blatant ambition.
        What good is his pride? . . . But perhaps I digress:
        Let's speak of the man--not his nobleness.
        Can you bestow, without feeling like a rat,
        A girl like this on a man like that?
        And shouldn't you think of propriety
        And foresee the end with anxiety?
        We know that some girls cannot remain chaste
        If their husband's tush is not to their taste,
        And that the best-laid plans for an honest life
        Are somewhat easier for the best-laid wife,
        And that many a man with a horned head
        Has driven his wife to another man's bed.
        It is entirely too much to ask
        That a wife be faithful to a flabby ass.
        And one who gives a girl to a man she hates
        Is guilty before God for all her mistakes.
        Consider the perils you expose yourself to.
<b>Orgon.</b>  So you think I should learn how to live from you!
<b>Dorine.</b>  You could do worse than follow my lead.
<b>Orgon.</b>  Dear daughter, do drop this maid's daffy creed;
        I know what's best for you in this affair.
        It's true I betrothed you to young Valere,
        But I hear he likes his dicing and drinking
        And even worse is inclined to free-thinking.
        I note with regret we don't see him at mass.
